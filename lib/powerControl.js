/**
 * C☯︎DEX-AI — Power control (used by .restart and .shutdown)
 *
 * Both do the same graceful cleanup app.js does on SIGTERM (flush pending
 * credentials, close the socket, release the single-instance lock) and then
 * exit the process. They differ only in the exit code:
 *
 *   restart  → exit code 1  — hosts treat this as "the bot stopped by itself"
 *              and start it again (panel auto-restart, PM2, Docker restart
 *              policy), so the bot comes straight back up.
 *   shutdown → exit code 0  — a clean exit, which panels leave stopped. It
 *              stays off until you press Start on the panel. Under PM2 it also
 *              runs `pm2 stop` so PM2 doesn't bring it back.
